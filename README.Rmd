This is a simple program that creates a Sierpinski triangle. From a chosen 
starting point, the script goes halfway towards a random corner of the 
equilateral triangle and creates a new point. It then takes that point and goes
halfway to another random corner. This process is repeated again and again
and the points are recorded throughout. 

The impetus for creating this was a class assignment. For more information on
the program, process, and more, please visit my blog:
